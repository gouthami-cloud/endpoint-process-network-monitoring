 Endpoint Process & Network Visibility – Lab

  Objective
This lab demonstrates how a security analyst gains visibility into endpoint behavior by inspecting running processes, services, and active network connections using PowerShell.

  Tools Used
- Windows
- PowerShell

  What I Did  

- Identified high CPU-consuming processes
- Reviewed running services for anomalies
- Inspected active TCP connections for suspicious remote activity

 Key Learning

  Most security incidents can be detected early by understanding what "normal" looks like on an endpoint. 
 Processes, services, and network connections often reveal malicious behavior before alerts trigger.

SOC Relevance

- Endpoint Detection
- Threat Hunting
- Alert Triage
